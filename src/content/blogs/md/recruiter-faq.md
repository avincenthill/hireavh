üëã Hi! I wanted to save you some time by answering some questions you may or may not have about me!

## Email
alexanderjvincenthill@gmail.com

## Phone
(541) 602-9122. Unfortunately I can't take unscheduled calls - please email me scheduling requests!

## Resume
See [here](/resume).

## GitHub/LinkedIn/Other Contact Info
See [here](/contact).

## Work Authorization
I'm a US citizen.

## Recent Work Experience
For the last year, I built a customer platform for Zume Inc. to help customers use Zume's food-truck fleet logistics services as a Full Stack Software Engineer. This project was 75% frontend in Vue.js and 25% backend with Node.js microservices and Postgres databases. I also built a Message Bus Node.js library over a Kafka implementation to enable services to produce and consume events to each other.

Before that, I worked on dynamic creative and media buying automation interfaces with React.js at a digital media agency called Fetch.

## Reason for Job Search
My Full Stack Software Engineer position at Zume Inc. was [restructured](https://thespoon.tech/report-zume-to-lay-off-80-percent-of-its-staff/) along with 300 other people's positions on 13 Jan 2020. I have been job searching since then.

## Status of Job Search
I'm in the middle stage - I've had a couple onsites and call/tech screen with different companies.

## Preference for Job Title
Full-stack or Frontend Software Engineer.

## Preference for Company Size
No preference - the hiring manager, product, and team are better predictors of a good fit and a good experience for me.

## Preference for Relocation
Most of the jobs I'm interviewing for are in the San Francisco Bay Area, but I'm open to relocating to Seattle, New York, Western Europe or East Asia. I'm much more interested in what I'd be doing that where I'd be doing it.

## Preference for Remote Work
I'm open to any percentage of remote work.

## Preference for Compensation
I'd like to be paid market rates similar to coworkers with the same amount of experience - I can't provide a hard number/range as this would change based on the company, role, and team.
